A.  Explain what recursion is and when it is useful.
    Explain what the |termination step| and |recursion step| are in a recursive method.
    Recursion is a base programming way in java, which a method calls itself to solve some problem. The method that uses the way is recursion.  
    Recursion can solve many programing problems.

B.  Describe the difference between a Queue and a Stack.
    The main difference between the two is how new elements enter the list and old elements leave the list.
    Stack is defined as a list of element in which we can insert or delete elements only at the top of the stack.
    Queue is a collection of the same type of element.It is a linear list in which insertions can take place at one end of the list 

C.  Write a class for an element of a doublely-linked list.
    public class DLnkList{
  
       private DLnk head = new DLnk();
       public int length = 0;
  
    public DLnkList(){}
  
    public void addDLnk(DLnk newlink){
       newlink.setNext(this.head);
       this.head.setPrev(newlink);
       this.head=newlink;
       length=length + 1;}

    public DLnk getiLnk(int i){
       DLnk it = this.head;
       while(i>0){
       it=it.getNext();
       i=i-1;}
     return it;}
  
    public void removeHead(){
       this.head=this.head.getNext();
       this.head.setPrev(null);
       length = length -1;}
  
    public DLnk getHead(){
       return this.head;}
   
     }

D.  Explain what a Merkle Tree is.  
    Describe the structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree.
    What is the Merkle root?
    What is the function of a certificate in this data structure?
    
     Merkle Tree is a tree where the leaf nodes contain the hashes of some data blocks, and the internal nodes contain hashes of their 
     children. It provides a quick way to verify data.Merkle tree are useful because they allow efficient and secure verification of
     the contents of large data structures. Merkle trees are a generalization of hash lists and hash chains.
    
    the Merkle root is the hash of all the hashes of all the transactions in the block. The Merkle root is included in the block header.
    
    The certificate of Merkle tree is a simple binary tree consisting of hashed leaves and nodes.Leaves are the hashes of individual
    certificates that have been appended to the log. Nodes are the hashes of paired child leaves or paired child nodes.
