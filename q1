Consider the following Java class.

public class Wizard{

  Spell[] spells;
  Potion[] potions;
  String name;
  int points=0;
  
  public Wizard(String name){
    this.name = name;}
    
}

A.  Write a method for the Wizard class named "powerUp" that adds 10 to the field "points".
    public static void powerup(int p){
        p = this.points + 10;
    }
    
B.  Write a method "cast" that casts the n-th element of the "spells" array.  
    Include an interface (seperately) for the Spell class to insure your "cast" method will interact with the class.
    public Spell cast(int n){
       return spells[n-1];}
       
    public interface Spellcaster{
       public Spell cast();}
       
C.  Write a "hello" method that prints an introduction stating the name of the Wizard.
    public void hello(){
       System.out.println("Hi, my name is " + this.name + ". I am a Wizard.");
    }
    
D.  Write a main method for the Wizard class.  In it construct a wizard with name "Harry Poppins".  Use the hello() method.
    public static void main(String[] args){
       Wizard Wantcode = new Wizard("Harry Poppins");
       Wantcode.hello();
    }
